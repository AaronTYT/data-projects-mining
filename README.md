# Data-Projects-Mining Portfolio
This repository showcases a portfolio of **simulated data science projects** inspired by real-world scenarios in the **mining industry.** Each project is designed to address key operational challenges commonly faced in mining environments, such as **haul truck route inefficiencies, equipment optimization, and safety risks.** <br>
**Disclaimer:** The datasets used are fictional or anonymized and do not represent any proprietary or confidential information. However, the methods and analytical approaches reflect industry-relevant practices and are aligned with typical workflows used by data professionals in mining operations.
